# Classification-of-Skin-Cancer
Trained a Deep Convolution Neural Network using a dataset of ISIC Archive 


The dataset consists of 1200 pictures of benign moles and 1058 pictures of malignant classified moles. The pictures have all been resized to low resolution (100x75x3) RGB. We developed a model which can classify a mole visually into benign and malignant. In this kernel we tried to detect two different classes of moles using Convolution Neural Network with keras tensorflow in backend.
